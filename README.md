# Introduction

There's a theoretical programming language - the simply typed lambda calculus - which is studied a bunch in computer science.

In that theoretical world, you can't call a function if you haven't defined it yet. If I want to call `f` in another function `g`, I have to first define `f()` before defining `g()`:

```
def f():
  retun 3

def g():
  return f()+1
```

This breaks recursion: you can't call yourself, because you haven't finished defining yourself yet.

Luckily in most languages, that isn't a problem - theory be damned, this Python code runs just fine:

```
def fib(n):
  if n == 0 or n == 1:
    return 1
  else:
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

for n in range(0,7):
  print(fib(n))    
```

```
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
```

<p>Why does that work without <code>fib</code> being defined first?</p>
<p>Because Python doesn't try to look up the recursive definition of <code>fib</code> until you *run* <code>fib</code> and reach the recursive call. By that time, <code>fib</code> has definitely been defined.</p>
<p>
  That can be made a bit more explicit: when <code>fib</code> is called recursively, roughly something like this happens, using a lookup in the global dictionary:
</p>

<pre>
def fib(n):
  if n == 0 or n == 1:
    return 1
  else:
    myself = globals()["fib"]
    return myself(n-1) + myself(n-2)
</pre>

<p>So, when fib runs, it doesn't call *itself* as such, but asks the global environment for the name of a function called <code>fib</code> and calls that. And in most cases, that's the right function and everyone is happy.</p>

<p>So how can we break this?
</p>

<p>There are a few examples (recursive lambda, serialization (eg over the network/to files)) that I'd like to explore but for now, here's a problem that arises with renaming functions:
</p>

<p>
I can give <code>fib</code> another name, like this:
  <pre>
  foo = fib
  
  for n in range(0,7):
    print(foo(n))
  </pre>
and it seems to run just fine, recursively calling... itself?
  <pre>
1
1
2
3
5
8
13  
  </pre>

<p>If it really is recursively calling itself, we can get rid of the top level <code>fib</code> definition: after all, it's called <code>foo</code> now, right?
</p>

<pre>
  del fib
  for n in range(0,7):
    print(foo(n))
</pre>

<pre>
1
1
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "a.py", line 18, in &lt;module>
    print(foo(n))
  File "a.py", line 7, in fib
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
NameError: global name 'fib' is not defined
</pre>

<p>boom! this code prints the first two values correctly (because no recursion is needed) but as soon as the code tries to recurse, it explodes: even though the function is called <code>foo</code> now, it is still trying to call <code>fib</code> to recurse, rather than calling itself.</p>

<p>So recursive code, at least in this style, is reliant on a global dictionary entry that aligns with the function definition: a recursive function isn't a free-standing object, in the way that a non-recursive function is.</p>

<hr/>

<p>
  That's a bit of a contrived situation, so I'll show two more practical cases: writing recursive functions using <code>lambda</code> expressions, and serialising functions using <code>dill</code> (for example to send over a network for execution).
</p>

<p>
In the first example, I'm going to try defining fibonnacci as a lambda expression. I want to be able to write some code like this:
</p>
  
<pre>
  for n in range(0,7):
    print( (lambda n: .......) (n) )
</pre>

<p>In that example, <code>.......</code> is some code that still needs writing. The base cases are easy:
<pre>
lambda n: 1 if n == 0 or n == 1 else .......
</pre>
but now the recursive case remains: the lambda needs to call itself. But how? There's no reference anywhere to itself to use. So it looks like recursive lambda expressions are impossible.
</p>

<p>
The next example is serialising functions using `dill` and then trying to deserialise and execute them elsewhere. This is something that happens a lot in one of my projects (<a href="http://parsl-project.org/">Parsl</a>) which aims to help you run Python code distributed across many computers.
</p>
<p>
  The first bit of code defines recursive <code>fib</code> as before (which we know works in a normal environment) and serialises it out to a file. The second bit of code loads that serialised function from a file, and tries to run it in a loop: so the very first example is split into two sections, separated by a serialisation/deserialisation. You could perhaps imagine that it is being deserialised on a different machine, in the Parsl case.
</p>

<p>Part 1:</p>

<pre>
def fib(n):
  if n == 0 or n == 1:
    return 1
  else:
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

from dill import dump

with open("fib.dill", "wb") as f:
  dump(fib, f)
</pre>

<p>Part 2:</p>

<pre>
with open("fib.dill", "rb") as f:
  user_supplied_function = load(f)

for n in range(0,7):
  print(user_supplied_function(n))
</pre>

<p>Running this, the first two (non-recursive) results work fine, but the recursive case breaks:</p>
<pre>
1
1
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "d2.py", line 17, in &lt;module>
    print(user_supplied_function(n))
  File "d1.py", line 5, in fib
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
NameError: name 'fib' is not defined
</pre>
<p>The function is trying to recurse using the global name <code>fib</code> still, even though that's not a name on the execution side - on the execution side, it's called <code>user_supplied_function</code>.
</p>
<p>
  With an ugly hack to make the global name <code>fib</code> available, the code does work, so you hopefully see that it's just the name that is missing, not anything worse:
</p>

<pre>
with open("fib.dill", "rb") as f:
  user_supplied_function = load(f)

fib = user_supplied_function

for n in range(0,7):
  print(user_supplied_function(n))
</pre>

<hr/>


<p>So core of the problem is that a function needs a reference to itself in order to recurse, and getting that reference from the global environment is not always possible, as the above examples have shown.</p>

<p>What other ways could a function get a reference to itself? One way that works in some situations is if the function takes its self as an argument, like this: 
</p>
<pre>
def fib(myself, n):
  if n == 0 or n == 1:
    return 1
  else:
    return myself(myself, n-1) + myself(myself, n-2)

for n in range(0,7):
  print(fib(fib, n))
</pre>

<p>That changes the calling convention into something quite ugly - but at least <code>fib</code> doesn't make use of any global binding.
</p>

<p>This helps a bit in the lambda case: a lambda expression can't be passed to itself as an argument without giving it a name somewhere, for example:

</p>

<pre>
for n in range(0,7):
  f = lambda myself, n: 1 if n==0 or n==1 else myself(myself, n-1) + myself(myself, n-2)
  print(f(f, n))
</pre>

<p>
but at least the lambda expression doesn't need to know the name. As long as the awkward calling convention is specified, that lambda expression could be passed around, even serialised using `dill`.
</p>

<hr/>
<p>There's a way to abstract away that awkward calling convention separately from the meat of the recursive function using a decorator. A decorator takes a python function definition, and returns a new function that will be bound to the global name instead of the original function definition.
</p>
<p>For example:
</p>

<pre>
@fix
def fib(self, n):
  if n == 0 or n == 1:
    return 1
  else:
    return self(n-1) + self(n-2)
</pre>

<p>This code will define a function with two parameters, and then pass it at a parameter to <code>fix</code>, and whatever <code>fix</code> returns is what will be bound to the global name <code>fib</code>. This is similar, but not quite the same, as writing this without using <code>@decorator</code> syntax:
 
</p>

<pre>
def _fib(self, n):

  if n == 0 or n == 1:
    return 1
  else:
    return self(n-1) + self(n-2)

fib = fix(_fib)
</pre>

<hr>
<p>So how should <code>fix</code> be defined?</p>

<pre>
def fix(base):

  def base_fix(self):

    def tied_fn(*args):
      rec = self(self)
      return base(rec, *args)

    return tied_fn

  return base_fix(base_fix)
</pre>

<p>It turns out to be a lot of wiring of names around without much else seemingly happening. Perhaps that should be unsurprising: The core of the recursion problem above is about getting the right name in the right place to recurse.</p>

<p>Using this, it's possible to make a recursive fibonacci that can be serialised between processes. And a recursive fibonacci using only <code>lambda</code> and <code>fix</code>, and even a recursive fibonacci defined using lambda that can be serialised between processes:</p>
  
  
<pre>
fiblambda = fix(lambda self, n: 1 if n == 0 or n == 1 else self(n-1) + self(n-2))
from dill import dump
with open("fiblambda.dill", "wb") as f:
  dump(fiblambda, f)
</pre>

<p>... fed into ...</p>

<pre>
with open("fiblambda.dill", "rb") as f:
  user_supplied_function = load(f)

for n in range(0,7):
  print(user_supplied_function(n))
</pre>

<hr>
<p>So 
<p>Another place in Python where some of this distinction between name and content in recursion comes into play is with recursive module import: that works with <code>import</code> but not with <code>from</code> - similar knot tying has to happen with module import and it happens to work one way and not the other.</p>
